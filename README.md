# AI Learner 

Welcome to the AI Learner project! </br>
This project aims to create an engaging and personalized learning environment for students and a guided activity created by the teacher for a structured path. Utilizing Flutter, Firebase, and Spring Boot, we've developed a platform that enhances educational experiences through advanced features and modern technologies.

## Features
**Learning from Activities**: The teacher can create learning activities with quizzes for students to learn and follow a structured path. The Learning Activity contains the title, aim, theory, video, conclusion and quiz.

**Interest-based Learning**: Implemented using Gemini AI to tailor learning materials according to students' interests. example: if a student is interested in OOP then AI will teach the student using his interest which will help him depth understanding.

**Personalized Learning**: Facilitates better engagement by offering content personalized to each student's learning preferences.
        

## Tech Stack
 
**Flutter**: For the frontend development, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience.
    
**Firebase**: Provides robust backend services such as authentication, real-time database, and cloud storage.
    
**Spring Boot**: Powers the server-side application, enabling efficient and scalable backend processing.

## Flow 

### Student View
1. **Attempt Learning Activity**:Engage with learning materials created by teachers

2. **Taking the Quiz**: Assess understanding through quizzes

3. **Generating Examples Based on Interest**:
        Receive personalized examples to enhance understanding

4. **Doubt Solving AI Bot**:Ask questions and receive answers from an AI bot</br>
Example query: "Explain OOP in terms of Cricket"
        Example response: "Players, ball, and field are objects; each has specific attributes (e.g., player's name, ball's position) and behaviors (e.g., player's batting, ball's movement)."

### Teacher View

1. **Creating the Learning Activity**:</br>

        Set Aim/Objectives</br>
        Provide Theory</br>
        Attach Videos</br>
        Write Conclusions</br>

2. **Monitoring Learning Process**:</br>
        Track student progress through quizzes.
